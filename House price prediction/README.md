# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION
This project implements a house price prediction system using Python and various machine learning algorithms. The system predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, and other relevant attributes. The implementation leverages libraries including scikit-learn, numpy, seaborn, and pandas, and utilizes linear regression for price prediction.
Price Prediction provides accurate predictions of house prices based on input features.
Data Handling uses a dataset sourced from an online platform to ensure predictions are based on comprehensive and up-to-date information.
Visualization employs seaborn for visualizing data and model performance, aiding in analysis and interpretation.
Machine Learning Algorithms implements linear regression from scikit-learn to model and predict house prices.
scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms, specifically linear regression.
numpy is used for numerical operations and data manipulation.
seaborn is used for data visualization and creating informative plots.
pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
The system uses a dataset with house features and prices sourced from an online platform. The dataset includes attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors.
Data visualizations, including model performance and feature importance, are generated using seaborn. These visualizations provide insights into the data and the effectiveness of the prediction model.
