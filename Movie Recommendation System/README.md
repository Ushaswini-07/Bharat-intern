This project implements a movie recommendation system using Python and various machine learning algorithms. The system is designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and historical data. The implementation leverages popular libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, seaborn, and pandas. The data for this system is sourced from an up-to-date online movie database.
Personalized Recommendations provides tailored movie suggestions based on user preferences.
Data Handling utilizes data from an online platform to ensure recommendations are based on the latest movie information.
Visualization uses seaborn to visualize data and insights, enhancing understanding and debugging.
Machine Learning Algorithms employs various algorithms from scikit-learn to generate recommendations.
scikit-learn is used for implementing machine learning algorithms.
numpy is used for numerical operations and data manipulation.
seaborn is used for data visualization and creating informative plots.
pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
The system uses a comprehensive dataset of movies obtained from an online platform. The dataset includes details such as movie titles, genres, ratings, and more.
