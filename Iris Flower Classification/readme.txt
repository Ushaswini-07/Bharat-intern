This project implements an Iris flower classification system using Python and machine learning algorithms. The system classifies Iris flowers into one of three species based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The implementation uses libraries including scikit-learn, numpy, seaborn, and pandas, with a focus on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.
Flower Classification predicts the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements.
Data Handling utilizes the Iris dataset, a classic dataset for classification tasks.
Visualization employs seaborn to visualize data distributions and model performance.
Machine Learning Algorithms implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scikit-learn.
scikit-learn is used for implementing the KNN classifier and evaluating the model.
numpy is used for numerical operations and data manipulation.
seaborn is used for data visualization and creating informative plots.
pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
The system uses the Iris dataset, which includes measurements of Iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and their corresponding species. This dataset is widely used for demonstrating classification algorithms and is available through scikit-learn.
Data visualizations such as scatter plots, feature distributions, and decision boundaries are generated using seaborn. These plots help in understanding the data and evaluating the performance of the KNN classifier.
